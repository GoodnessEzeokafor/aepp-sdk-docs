# Development Documentation Style Guide

## Values & Voice
Since every word we say is an extension of our brand, our goal is to ensure the highest quality when it comes to the things we create and the documentation we generate to explain it. Although we don’t expect any of you to be professional copywriters, the following are some basics that we would like everyone to follow.

- We are kind, courteous and approachable. Using words like “you” and “us” is encouraged to keep the tone light and conversational.
- We are friendly, safe, and inclusive. Whenever possible please try to spread gender pronouns in a 50/50 context. When in doubt, it is best to err on the side of the feminine.
- We value open dialog. Our writing should always feel like an invitation to participate in an ongoing conversation with other developers. 
- We use US English as our standard. We are writing for the world, and US English is the most commonly used variant.
- We respect our growing community. When in doubt about something feel free to refer to our Code of Conduct. 

## Tone & Document Structure

Although tone is a dynamic concept and should adapt to each individual document, it is always our goal to be conversational and descriptive, while simultaneously being as clear and unpretentious as possible. To help with this, here are a few things to remember when writing documentation.

Begin with a heading **and** an introduction. Title the first section ‘Overview’, and use it to explain the purpose of the document. By giving your document a clear and descriptive title, and by taking the time to create an overview of what you are covering you will create a succinct clarity that pulls your audience in.

Break down points like a table of contents. Bear in mind that your article will ultimately appear with a table of contents. If you choose your subheadings appropriately  this will make the read smoother and help users to find what they’re looking for.

Use full names. Hyperlink early and often. When referencing other pieces of content, software projects or an organization, make sure to mention their full name and wherever possible link to the website, project page, or an explanation on some site such as Wikipedia. Do this as early as possible in your documentation to avoid confusion.

## Markup & Formatting

We write all our documents using Markdown. Please give the page title a ‘#’ prefix, and the sections ‘##’. Below this, add ‘#’s as you see fit. This helps us to give our documents a common look and feel.
