# Faucets proposal

## Overview

We want to be able to give small numbers of tokens to users to play with so they can develop for Ã†ternity. I propose that we build various ways for users to do this, with a common backend recording and managing allocations. The different ways should include:

- A website into which users can enter their public key, and possibly a Github login, to prevent attacks.
- An oracle
- A contract on each of the 3 VMs. 

The faucets would form part of the set of sample apps and be documented in the aepp-sdk-docs repo, in order that they also perform a pedagogical function.
